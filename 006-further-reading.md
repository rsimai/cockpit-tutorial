# What next?

Well now you've reached the end. From here, you can work on the application you want to build. Before I provide a list of links to visit and read up on, I'll take a minute to talk to you about some things I've learned. JavaScript is a weird language, alot of the issue with JavaScript is, everything can be depreciated and nothing can be removed. This is the legacy and curse of being the only language natively supported on the web.

You may consider wanting to use TypeScript. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, all JavaScript is valid TypeScript, but TypeScript adds types to help with development of JavaScript but upstream Cockpit does not at the time of writing support TypeScript. If you really wish to jump in head first look at the type subsection in the [cockpit-tukit repo](https://github.com/openSUSE/cockpit-tukit/tree/master/types). Good luck and god speed.
